# Only for my selfe:
# Changelog: V1 to V2

## General Updates
- **Title Change**: Updated from "Arch Linux Gaming Ready Installation Guide" to  
  "Arch Linux Installation Guide on Nvidia V2".
- **Arch Wiki Link**: Added a link to the official Arch Wiki for additional reference.

## Styling and Formatting
- **Font Update**: Changed to 'Inter' in a semi-bold format.
- **Code Block Layout**: Adjusted for a cleaner appearance, placing the copy button  
  next to the code block without resizing.
- **Highlight Colors**: Introduced new color-coded text for better readability and  
  to emphasize key information (e.g., commands, optional steps).

## Guide-Specific Changes
- **Step 11 (Setup swapfile)**: Now marked as an optional step.
- **Step 13 (Install Requirements)**: Added a note allowing the use of Vim as an  
  alternative text editor.
- **Step 14 (Configure Arch System)**: Included a new command  
  (`sudo systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd`) to ensure proper time synchronization.
- **Step 21 (Change Timezone)**: Modified to be an extra step if the timezone  
  doesn't load correctly.
- **Step 24 (Install yay and paru)**: Consolidated the installation commands into  
  a single Pacman command.
- **Step 25 (Chaotic-AUR Repos)**: Refined instructions for editing `pacman.conf`  
  for clearer repository placement.
- **CachyOS Package Installation (Steps 26-28)**: The previous combined step  
  ("Install CachyOS Kernel Manager & Other Things") was split into three separate  
  steps for individual installation of:
  - CachyOS Kernel Manager  
  - Gaming Meta  
  - Settings
- **Step 29 (Open NVIDIA Drivers)**: Changed from a "recommended" to an "optional"  
  installation.
- **Step 32 (Final Update)**: A new step was added for a final system update  
  (`sudo pacman -Syuu`).
